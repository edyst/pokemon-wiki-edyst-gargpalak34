                            In the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found
                            they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan
                            won acclaim for reporting that he&#39;d lost 65 pounds between July and
                            December.

                            <p>&quot;Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper. It is
                                the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter Pokémon for the original
                                game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful
                                opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything.
                                However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.

                </h2>
                <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite
                            well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you
                            should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s evolutionary chain. Pikachu,
                            mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
                            generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this
                            species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers
                            should be able to answer.
                          </li>
                        <li>
                            Answer is Raichu
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model you start
                                your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you&#39;re
                                looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in
                                later routes. If you&#39;ve made your way through any Pokemon game,
                                you&#39;ve reached the point where you&#39;re presented with the most
                                effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button
                                mashing at all is required.

                            Pokémon Go&#39;s Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon
  games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief,
  things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers
  to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them
  slightly closer in line.
